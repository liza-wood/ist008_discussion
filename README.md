# ist008 discussion notes

Here is a place that I will store code we write during our discussion sessions. You can look at it by clicking on the script name above. Please DO NOT edit it on GitHub (actually, you should never do this even on your own repositories -- stay away from that pencil symbol!), but you are able to copy and paste from it.  

Here is the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zyCafFKLEHu5uO5XnVaCcXRirURNGn5fGhp2I427wy8/edit) we use during class. Feel free to answer others' (or your own) questions as we go.
